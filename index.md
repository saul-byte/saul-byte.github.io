### CPSC 120



* Lab 1



    Lab 1, Part 1 was one of my favorite programs because me and my partner engaged in the traditional rite of passage for when you first code in a high-level programming language like C++. I was able to write a variation of the infamous 'Hello World' program which served as an introduction to the fundamental concepts of input and output in C++. Alongside the input and output, I was also practiced ending lines and standard interpretation of C++ as a language.


* Lab 5



    Lab 5, Part 2 had a significant impact on me because of how math-orientated the lab was. The conversion between the data types of _"int"_ and _"double"_ with the application of the imperial measurments like inches and feet left me feeling satisfied during coding because the program was very applicable to real-life scenarios. Besides the intention of the program, the actual coding was challenging in an amazing way, since we had to create if-else statements and deal with limits as well.


* Lab 11


    Lab 11, Part 1 ended being a terrific assignment that introduced Object-Orientated Programming __OOP__, and class structuring. This one was the most difficult lab I had done at the time because of the switch from _Procedural Programming_ to _OOP_ which was abrupt but necessary as _OOP_ is a more applicable form of programming in C++ that would prepare me for future endeavors. I also enjoyed this lab considering I employed many strategies of coding from my entire semester of learning like for loops, data-type conversions, vectors, push_back, etc.
