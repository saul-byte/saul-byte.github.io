CPSC 120
Lab 1



    Lab 1, Part 1 was one of my favorite programs because me and my partner did the traditional rite of passage for when you first code in a high-level programming language like C++. I was able to write a variation of the infamous "Hello World" program which served as an intro to the very basics of input and output in C++. Alongside the input and output, I was also practiced ending lines and standard interpretation of C++ as a language.



Lab 5



    Lab 5, Part 2 had a significant impact on me because of how math-orientated the lab was. The conversion between the data types of "int" and "double" with the application of the imperial measurments like inches and feet left me feeling satisfied during coding because the program was very applicable to real-life scenarios. Besides the intention of the program, the actual coding was challenging in an amazing way, since we had to create if-else statements and deal with limits as well.


Lab 11


    Lab 11, Part 1 ended being a terrific assignment that introduced Object-Orientated Programming OOP, and class structuring. This one was the most difficult lab I had done at the time because of the switch from Procedural Programming to OOP was abrupt but necessary as OOP is a more applicable form of programming in C++ which would only prepare me for the future. I also enjoyed this lab considering I employed various strategies of coding from my entire semester of learning like for loops, data-type conversions, vectors, push_back, etc.
